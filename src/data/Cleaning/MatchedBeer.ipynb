    "# Data Analysis and Cleaning of MatchedBeer Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The MatchedBeer dataset combines data from BeerAdvocate and RateBeer, two of the most prominent online platforms for beer ratings. This combined dataset was created to address the herding effect in online ratings, where early ratings can skew subsequent user opinions. By merging the two platforms, the MatchedBeer dataset allows for the study of the same beers rated independently on each platform, thereby providing a unique opportunity to analyze unbiased rating patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matching Process Overview\n",
    "The matching process is described in detail in the paper [\"When Sheep Shop: Measuring Herding Effects in Product Ratings with Natural Experiments\"](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Lederrey-West_WWW-18.pdf), focusing on accurately aligning beers from both websites. The matching is performed in two phases to prioritize precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Brewery Alignment**: Breweries across BeerAdvocate and RateBeer are aligned based on their exact location (state or country), with names represented as TF-IDF vectors to compute cosine similarity.\n",
    "2. **Beer Alignment**: Within matched breweries, beers are aligned based on name similarity and require an exact match in alcohol by volume (ABV). Before matching, any shared tokens in brewery and beer names are removed to improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm ensures high precision by setting strict thresholds for cosine similarity and enforcing a significant gap between the best and second-best matches. This approach results in a dataset where brewery matching has a reported precision of 99.6%, and beer matching achieves a precision of 100%, meaning that only highly confident matches are included, though some potential matches may be excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of MatchedBeer Dataset\n",
    "The dataset contains essential information on beers, breweries, users, and user ratings from both platforms. Since the user bases of BeerAdvocate and RateBeer differ geographically, the combined dataset reflects a more balanced view. BeerAdvocate is more U.S.-centric, while RateBeer has a more internationally diverse user base. Despite these differences, the matched dataset has been verified for both internal and external validity, making it well-suited for analyzing the influence of initial ratings on user perceptions across platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "MatchedBeer provides insights into how early ratings impact subsequent ones by comparing ratings for the same beer on both sites, especially when early ratings on each platform differ significantly. By standardizing and aligning ratings across time and platforms, MatchedBeer reveals patterns that allow for the identification of herding effects, helping researchers understand the biases in user-generated ratings."

    "1. Alcohol By Volume (ABV)\n",
    "   - The `abv_ba` and `abv_rb` columns show identical distributions across BeerAdvocate and RateBeer, with a mean ABV of approximately 6.32%.\n",
    "   - This similarity suggests a good alignment in the types of beers reviewed on both platforms. The maximum ABV of 67.5% is possibly an outlier, likely representing rare extreme beers, as typical ABVs are much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Average Ratings (BeerAdvocate vs. RateBeer)\n",
    "   - The `avg_ba` (BeerAdvocate) mean is 3.73, while `avg_rb` (RateBeer) is significantly lower at 3.14.\n",
    "   - This aligns with previous findings that BeerAdvocate users tend to rate beers more generously than RateBeer users. The higher `std` value for `avg_ba` also indicates a wider range in BeerAdvocateâ€™s ratings, suggesting more variability in user opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Computed Averages (Consistency in Ratings)\n",
    "   - `avg_computed_ba` and `avg_computed_rb` refer to recalculated averages, showing slightly lower standard deviations than their direct counterparts (`avg_ba` and `avg_rb`), indicating a slight smoothing effect.\n",
    "   - Both BeerAdvocate and RateBeer have computed averages (`avg_computed_ba` vs. `avg_computed_rb`) that are fairly close to the respective raw averages, implying that the original averages align well with user trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rating Counts\n",
    "   - The median `nbr_ratings_ba` (3) and `nbr_ratings_rb` (5) are relatively low, showing that many beers have few ratings on both sites, though RateBeer has slightly more ratings per beer on average.\n",
    "   - RateBeerâ€™s broader user base also shows a higher standard deviation in the count of matched valid ratings (`nbr_matched_valid_ratings_rb` is 80.10 vs. 42.51 for BeerAdvocate), meaning some beers have far more reviews than others on RateBeer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Z-scores (Standardized Ratings)\n",
    "   - The mean `zscore_ba` (-0.41) is lower than `zscore_rb` (-0.10), suggesting BeerAdvocate users' ratings tend to deviate more below the mean, which may imply a slight rating inflation on RateBeer.\n",
    "   - BeerAdvocateâ€™s z-scores also exhibit a broader spread, evidenced by a standard deviation of 0.81 compared to RateBeer's 0.73, reinforcing the idea that BeerAdvocate reviews show more polarized opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Score Difference and Similarity\n",
    "   - `diff_scores` has a mean of 0.798, which indicates a considerable average difference in the ratings across the two platforms.\n",
    "   - `sim_scores`, however, is high (mean of 0.986), suggesting that while individual score values differ, the rating trends between matched pairs are generally consistent."
