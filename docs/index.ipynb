    "# The World of Beer: A Data-Driven Journey into Global Preferences\n",
    "Beer. It’s not just a beverage; it’s a cultural phenomenon, a historical artifact, and a science experiment in a glass. Across centuries and continents, it has brought people together, inspired innovation, and evolved into a deeply personal yet global phenomenon. But what makes one beer an instant hit and another a forgettable sip? Is it the richness of its taste, the aroma that wafts from the glass, or perhaps something as intangible as the mood of the moment? With data in hand and curiosity as our guide we aim to answer to one simple question: what shapes our beer preferences, and how do these preferences differ globally and over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we’ve turned to RateBeer, a globally renowned beer rating platform, to analyze beer preferences and ratings across the world. While we initially considered the BeerAdvocate dataset, its strong US-centric bias led us to choose RateBeer, which offers a more diverse and geographically distributed dataset. With this choice, we aim to explore the global beer landscape in a way that represents a wide array of cultures and tastes."

    "## Meet the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the nuanced world of beer preferences, let's take a moment to introduce the cornerstone of this analysis: the **RateBeer dataset**. With its global reach and detailed reviews, RateBeer provides us with the perfect lens to understand what drives beer preferences across different regions and over time. Unlike the BeerAdvocate dataset, which leans heavily toward U.S.-based reviews, RateBeer offers a more balanced, international perspective on beer culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Snapshot of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what the RateBeer dataset offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **50,592 users**: Beer lovers from across the globe, each with their unique tastes and preferences.\n",
    "- **399,987 beers**: From craft IPAs to dark stouts, capturing a wide variety of beer styles and origins.\n",
    "- **7,123,786 ratings**: Detailed reviews and scores that reveal insights into the core attributes of a beer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Interactive Map\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the global distribution of beers, users, breweries, and number of ratings  we’ve created a simple interactive map. This visualization allows you to navigate through the data and explore beer preferences across countries and U.S. states.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div id=\"flat-map-container\">\n",
    "    ![Flat Map](./plots/flat_map.html)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the map we see that through almost every category the distribution is the same. For beers we see that the United States has the most beers, followed by the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and Denmark. For users we see that the United States has the most users, followed by the United Kingdom, Canada, Poland, and Australia. For breweries we see that the United States has the most breweries, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Canada. For reviews based on brewery location we see that the United States has the most reviews, followed by the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, and Canada. For reviews based on user location we see that the United States has the most reviews, followed by the Denmark, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Sweden. Keep in mind for all of this data that the United States has the most data by a fairly large margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this map we can see that the United States is the most active country in the dataset, with the most beers, users, breweries, and reviews. This is due to the large number of users and breweries in the United States, as well as the popularity of craft beer in the country. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany also have a significant presence in the dataset, with a large number of beers, users, and breweries. Other countries such as Denmark, Belgium, and Italy also have a notable presence in the dataset, with a significant number of beers, users, and breweries. It is particualrly interesting to see that the beers being reviewed (based on brewery location) are from countries with a strong beer culture, such as Belgium, Germany, and the United States and the reviews based on user location are also coming from countries with not as strong of a beer production culture, such as Denmark and Sweden.\n",
    "\n",
    "With primarily the same countries being the most active in all categories, it raises some questions regarding global beer preferences. Are these countries producing the best beers? Are they the most active in reviewing beers? Are they the most active in producing beers? Do certain countries have similar beer preferences? These are some of the questions we will explore in this analysis.\n",

    "## General Preference Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution of Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive deeper into the complexities of beer preferences, let’s zoom out and examine the broader landscape. How are beers rated? Are some attributes more valued than others? What patterns emerge when we look at millions of reviews from beer enthusiasts worldwide?\n",
    "\n",
    "What truly defines the appeal of a beer? Is it the bold aroma that wafts from the glass? The golden clarity of its appearance? Or perhaps the complex flavors that linger on the palate? To answer these questions, we turn to the structure of the RateBeer dataset. Each review evaluates a beer based on five key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aroma**: The beer's smell, scored out of 10.\n",
    "- **Appearance**: Its color, clarity, head, and visual carbonation, scored out of 5.\n",
    "- **Taste**: The flavor, including bitterness, palate, and finish, scored out of 10.\n",
    "- **Mouthfeel**: The beer’s body, carbonation, and astringency, scored out of 5. *(Labeled as \"Palate\" in the dataset.)*\n",
    "- **Overall**: A holistic score that captures the reviewer’s personal experience and the beer’s characteristics, scored out of 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these metrics form a **total score out of 50**, which is scaled down to a score out of 5. This approach captures a detailed snapshot of how each aspect contributes to the beer-drinking experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing the Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of ratings across these five metrics is shown in the plot below. By normalizing the scores into a 0–5 range, we can compare the attributes directly. What stands out?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Distribution of Ratings](plots/distribution_of_ratings.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Taste and aroma closely align with overall ratings, peaking near the higher end of the scale. This highlights their role as the backbone of a beer's impression—after all, they’re the first things you notice when you sip and smell. In contrast, appearance and mouthfeel lag slightly behind, with their distributions showing flatter peaks. This reinforces the idea that while these aspects matter, they’re more challenging to evaluate consistently. Appearance, for instance, might include factors like head retention or clarity, which vary depending on personal preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "A closer statistical analysis reveals even more nuances about these ratings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Normal Distributions**: None of the metrics follow a normal distribution. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirms that all categories deviate significantly from normality, emphasizing the unique, non-linear patterns in how users rate beers.\n",
    "- **Right-Skewed Ratings**: Most metrics, especially taste and aroma, exhibit a pronounced skew toward higher ratings. For instance, skewness values of -0.78 for taste and -0.77 for aroma reflect this tendency. Users tend to celebrate the beers they love rather than criticize those they don’t, resulting in more ratings clustered at the higher end of the scale.\n",
    "- **Median Values Indicate Priorities**: With median scores for taste, aroma, and overall hovering around 0.7 (on a normalized 0–1 scale), users clearly prioritize these attributes. Appearance and mouthfeel, while slightly lower at around 0.6, play secondary but still meaningful roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Psychology Behind Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "This bias toward higher scores could reflect a broader psychological trend. People generally avoid extremes when assigning subjective ratings. A 1/5 feels overly harsh unless a beer was genuinely awful, while a 3/5 might feel too neutral and uninspired. Instead, many gravitate toward 4/5 or even 5/5 ratings—scores that convey appreciation and enthusiasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trend also helps explain the steady increase in average ratings we’ll observe later. As more casual users join platforms like RateBeer, they bring with them a positive energy. Many of these users aren’t professional critics; they’re enjoying a beer with friends, caught up in the moment. A 5/5 might simply mean “this beer made me happy” rather than “this beer is technically flawless.” Over time, this influx of enthusiastic reviewers pulls the average ratings upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subjectivity in Complex Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes like appearance and mouthfeel present additional challenges. Unlike taste and aroma, which are intuitive and sensory-driven, these aspects are nuanced and subjective. What does a “perfect” mouthfeel mean? Is it the smoothness, the carbonation, or something else entirely? These questions make it harder to assign consistent scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of ratings not only reveals what users value but also hints at the biases and tendencies that shape these evaluations. This sets the stage for the next part of our journey: understanding how these patterns evolve over time and how they relate to correlations between attributes. Could the upward trend in ratings be driven by these psychological and social factors? Let’s continue to unravel the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hidden Links: Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "With the distribution of ratings in mind, we now turn our attention to how these attributes interact with each other. Are certain factors more influential in shaping a beer’s overall score? Or do all attributes play equally vital roles in crafting the perfect beer experience? To answer this, we examine the correlation matrix below, which reveals the relationships between beer attributes and their impact on overall ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Correlation Matrix](plots/correlation_matrix.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Big Picture: What Influences Overall Ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each attribute contributes to the overall beer experience, but not all attributes are created equal. Taste and aroma emerge as the undisputed stars, while other factors like appearance and palate play supporting yet meaningful roles. Let’s dive deeper into the key insights this matrix unveils:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Taste and Aroma: The Cornerstones of Beer Enjoyment\n",
    "\n",
    "With correlations of **0.86** and **0.77** with overall ratings, taste and aroma take center stage in the beer experience. This makes perfect sense—these are the most immediate and visceral aspects of enjoying a beer. Whether it’s the hop-forward bitterness of an IPA or the rich malty aroma of a stout, these elements shape the very essence of how a beer is perceived. If taste or aroma falls short, the overall impression of the beer is unlikely to recover, no matter how appealing it may look or feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, this aligns with the distribution analysis from earlier. Users tend to assign higher ratings to taste and aroma, which skew closely with the overall ratings. These two attributes are the easiest for users to evaluate — they’re sensory-driven and intuitive, requiring no prior expertise. The strong correlation here reinforces their status as the pillars of a great beer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Appearance and Palate: The Supporting Cast\n",
    "\n",
    "While appearance and palate don’t dominate the beer experience, they still play critical supporting roles. With correlations of **0.50** (appearance) and **0.66** (palate) with overall ratings, these factors act as the “finishing touches” that elevate a beer from good to great.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appearance is perhaps the most subjective of the attributes. Does the beer have a thick, creamy head? Is its color clear and vibrant? These are visual cues that can enhance the drinking experience but are often secondary to taste and aroma. The slightly lower correlation with overall ratings reflects this — they add polish, but they don’t make or break the beer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Palate, on the other hand, bridges the gap between flavor and texture. With its relatively high correlation of **0.66**, it’s clear that a beer’s mouthfeel - whether creamy, crisp, or effervescent — makes a significant impression. Palate is harder to evaluate than taste or aroma, but when done well, it leaves a lasting mark on the overall experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ABV: A Subtle but Noteworthy Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Alcohol by volume (ABV) may not seem like a game-changer, but its correlation of **0.37** with overall ratings reveals an intriguing trend. Higher ABV beers, such as imperial stouts, often leave stronger impressions on drinkers. They’re bold, intense, and memorable—characteristics that can influence a reviewer to assign a higher score.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ABV’s impact is more nuanced than the other attributes. Unlike taste or aroma, ABV isn’t directly sensory. Its influence may stem from the perception of complexity — higher ABV beers often feel more “crafted” or sophisticated, which could sway users to rate them more favorably. Still, ABV alone isn’t enough to carry a beer to greatness; it complements the other attributes rather than defining them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Harmonious Blend of Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "While each attribute plays its part, the overall beer experience is greater than the sum of its parts. Taste and aroma are the backbone, setting the foundation for a beer’s success. Appearance and palate add polish and texture, while ABV brings a subtle complexity that enhances the perception of certain beers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interplay also ties back to the trends we saw in the rating distributions. Attributes like taste and aroma, which are easier to evaluate, naturally dominate user preferences. Meanwhile, the more subjective aspects — appearance and palate—still matter but show less influence on overall ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the Stage for Time and Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation matrix also hints at another layer of insight: why ratings have steadily increased over time. With taste and aroma dominating user evaluations, it’s no surprise that breweries focused on refining these attributes as the beer industry evolved. This emphasis on sensory excellence likely contributed to the upward trend in average ratings, which we’ll explore in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue this data-driven journey, these correlations remind us that a great beer isn’t just about one thing—it’s about balance. The best beers are those that excel in multiple attributes, creating a harmonious blend that resonates with drinkers worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evolving Preferences: Ratings Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratings are not static — they tell a story, evolving alongside trends, technology, and the expanding beer market. To begin, we take a step back and observe how ratings have changed over the years. The map below provides a fascinating view of this evolution across countries:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average Ratings Over Time](plots/average_rating_time.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Global Shift in Beer Appreciation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we observe the animation, a few key patterns emerge. Over the years, the ratings grow consistently lighter on the map, indicating an increase in average ratings worldwide. Countries that were previously marked with darker shades (lower ratings) start blending into lighter, higher-rating territories. What’s even more striking is the convergence of colors between countries. Regions once characterized by distinct local preferences now appear more similar. This hints at an interesting phenomenon: an implicit global standardization of beer quality and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why are ratings increasing? Several possibilities arise. On one hand, advancements in brewing techniques, global competition, and the rise of craft breweries may have led to objectively better beers - though considering the relatively short time period the dataset covers this is fairly unlikely. On the other hand, this upward trend could be driven by changes in the behavior of reviewers themselves — a more forgiving attitude, an appreciation for novelty, or simply the excitement of discovering a new favorite drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Tale of Two Reviewer Groups: Top 5% vs. the Rest\n",
    "\n",
    "To dig deeper into this question, we compared two distinct groups of reviewers: the top 5% (most experienced users) and the general population. Their ratings over time reveal fascinating insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top 5% vs Rest Ratings](plots/top_5_vs_rest.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contrasting Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Steady Expertise in the Top 5%**:  \n",
    "   Among the top 5%, ratings increase gradually over the years. This reflects the behavior of experienced reviewers, who tend to approach scoring with consistent criteria and refined judgment. Their ratings evolve slowly, reflecting their deep knowledge and understanding of beer nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Hump in General Ratings**:  \n",
    "   Starting around 2008, the general population shows a notable \"hump\" in average ratings. This period aligns with a surge of new users joining the platform, many of whom were likely less experienced. Without the refined criteria of the experts, these casual reviewers often leaned toward extreme scores — **5/5 for beers they loved** and **1/5 for beers they disliked**. This influx likely skewed the averages upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Bias Toward Positivity**:  \n",
    "   A broader trend across the general population is the tendency to focus on positive experiences. People are more likely to review beers they enjoyed rather than beers they disliked. Think about it: Why go through the effort of reviewing a beer unless you were impressed enough to share your thoughts? This natural bias results in a predominance of higher ratings over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bringing the Story Together\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations bring us closer to understanding the interplay between expertise and enthusiasm in beer ratings. Experienced reviewers provide stability and depth, offering consistent insights into beer quality over time. Meanwhile, the growing wave of casual reviewers adds excitement, albeit with a tendency toward extreme scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, this section sets the stage for a key question: Are these increasing ratings purely reflective of better beers, or are they also influenced by shifting preferences and the types of beers being consumed? In the next section, **ABV and Style Studies**, we’ll dive into how alcohol content and beer styles have evolved over time and how they contribute to the changing landscape of beer preferences.\n"

    "### Global Trends in ABV\n",
    "\n",
    "As we zoom out and look at the global picture, the map below illustrates the average ABV in beers across different countries over time. Lighter colors indicate higher ABVs, and as we move through the years, the world becomes progressively lighter, signaling a steady increase in ABV.\n",

    "  1. **United States**: As the largest hub the U.S. stands out as a beacon of craft beer innovation, attracting global attention for its diverse and experimental offerings.\n",
    "  2. **Belgium**: Known for its centuries-old brewing heritage, Belgium draws enthusiasts from many countries with its rich array of beers.\n",
    "  3. **United Kingdom**: The U.K. is a global favorite for its traditional ales and craft beer scene.\n",
    "  4. **Germany**: Germany remains a stronghold of classic beer styles such as Pilsener, Hefeweizen, and Bocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clusters of Influence**:  \n",
    "  Each hub forms its own cluster of countries that are strongly influenced by its brewing tradition. For example:\n",
    "  - The United States appeals heavily to nations interested in bold and experimental craft beers.\n",
    "  - Belgium’s influence spans nations that value rich, high-ABV styles.\n",
    "  - Germany maintains its classic appeal for clean and precise beer styles, attracting Central and Eastern European nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interconnected Hubs**:  \n",
    "  A fascinating dynamic emerges when we look at how the major hubs influence and prefer one another. These relationships form a \"beer exchange\" of sorts, where preferences flow between hubs in a cyclic fashion:\n",
    "  - **The United States and Belgium**: The U.S. prefers Belgium’s renowned beers, drawn by their rich tradition and high-quality brews. Interestingly, this admiration is reciprocated — Belgium also favors American beers, showcasing a shared appreciation for the innovation and boldness of the U.S. craft beer scene.\n",
    "  - **Germany and Belgium**: Germany, with its precise and traditional brewing heritage, often looks to Belgium’s rich, experimental styles when seeking beers outside its own borders. The mutual respect between these brewing giants is a testament to their deep-rooted influence on global beer culture.\n",
    "  - **United Kingdom and the United States**: The U.K. frequently chooses American beers as its preferred foreign option. This is likely due to the adventurous and hoppy nature of U.S. craft beers, which complement the U.K.'s more traditional ale offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These interconnected relationships highlight not just the influence of these beer hubs but also the global exchange of beer styles, traditions, and innovations.
