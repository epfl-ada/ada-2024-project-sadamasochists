    "# The World of Beer: A Data-Driven Journey into Global Preferences\n",
    "Beer. It’s not just a beverage; it’s a cultural phenomenon, a historical artifact, and a science experiment in a glass. Across centuries and continents, it has brought people together, inspired innovation, and evolved into a deeply personal yet global phenomenon. But what makes one beer an instant hit and another a forgettable sip? Is it the richness of its taste, the aroma that wafts from the glass, or perhaps something as intangible as the mood of the moment? With data in hand and curiosity as our guide we aim to answer to one simple question: what shapes our beer preferences, and how do these preferences differ globally and over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we’ve turned to RateBeer, a globally renowned beer rating platform, to analyze beer preferences and ratings across the world. While we initially considered the BeerAdvocate dataset, its strong US-centric bias led us to choose RateBeer, which offers a more diverse and geographically distributed dataset. With this choice, we aim to explore the global beer landscape in a way that represents a wide array of cultures and tastes."

    "Before we dive into the nuanced world of beer preferences, let's take a moment to introduce the cornerstone of this analysis: the **RateBeer dataset**. With its global reach and detailed reviews, RateBeer provides us with the perfect lens to understand what drives beer preferences across different regions and over time. Unlike the BeerAdvocate dataset, which leans heavily toward U.S.-based reviews, RateBeer offers a more balanced, international perspective on beer culture.\n",

    "## General Preference Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hidden Links: Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to beer preferences, what stands out? Is it the alcohol content, the style, or perhaps something deeper about how beers are categorized and rated over time? Let's dive into the data to uncover some fascinating insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s explore how different beer attributes relate to one another. Intuitively, you might expect alcohol content (ABV) to have little impact on overall ratings. After all, a high ABV doesn’t guarantee a better beer. But surprisingly, we do see a moderate correlation between ABV and ratings—proof that stronger beers often leave a lasting impression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes like taste and aroma, however, are the real MVPs here, showing strong correlations with overall ratings. This makes sense; after all, what’s a beer without its signature flavor or a captivating aroma? Mouthfeel (or “palate”) and appearance, while important, play more supportive roles, rounding out the beer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Correlation Matrix](plots/correlation_matrix.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what we’ve uncovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Taste and Aroma**: These two attributes dominate the beer experience, with correlations of 0.86 and 0.77 respectively. If these fall flat, the overall rating is unlikely to shine.\n",
    "- **Appearance and Mouthfeel**: With correlations of 0.5 and 0.66, these attributes still contribute meaningfully to a beer’s overall impression.\n",
    "- **ABV**: While less influential (0.37 correlation), ABV still plays an interesting role, often elevating the perceived complexity of a beer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these insights remind us that a great beer is a harmonious blend of attributes, each adding its own flavor to the overall experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolving Preferences: Ratings Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Beer ratings aren’t static; they’ve evolved dramatically over time. Looking at the data, we notice a clear trend: ratings have steadily increased across most countries, particularly in major beer-drinking nations. On the maps below, you’ll see countries getting lighter and lighter over time—a reflection of this upward trend. Even more intriguing, the colors are converging across regions, suggesting a shift from local tendencies to a more global standard of beer appreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average Ratings Over Time](plots/average_rating_time.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what’s driving this change? One possibility is that breweries are simply getting better at their craft, creating beers that appeal to a wider audience. Another theory? New users on platforms like RateBeer might be more generous in their ratings, skewing the averages upward. After all, less experienced users are more likely to give extreme ratings—a 5/5 for their favorite beer or a 0/5 for a disappointing one. This contrasts with early “pro” raters, who likely had a more refined approach.\n",

    "### Evolving Preferences: Top 5% vs. the Rest\n",
    "\n",
    "![Top 5% vs Rest Ratings](plots/top_5_vs_rest.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph above presents a fascinating comparison between the average ratings of the **top 5% of users** (the most experienced reviewers) and the **general population** of reviewers. A few key trends emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slower Growth Among Experts**:  \n",
    "   The average ratings for the top 5% of users increase more steadily and at a somewhat slower rate compared to the rest. This aligns with the idea that experienced reviewers tend to have more refined and consistent criteria when rating beers. They’re less likely to give extreme scores, maintaining a balanced approach that evolves gradually over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The \"Hump\" Effect in the General Population**:  \n",
    "   The general population shows a noticeable hump in ratings starting around 2008, corresponding to a significant influx of new users on the platform. This surge brought in less experienced reviewers, who often rate beers with extreme scores— like a **5/5** for a beer they enjoy or a **0/5** for one they dislike. This pattern contributes to the more pronounced increase in average ratings among the general population during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **A Bias Toward Positive Ratings**:  \n",
    "   Interestingly, the general increase in ratings over time can also be attributed to the tendency of reviewers to rate positively. Think about it—most people aren’t likely to order a beer they believe will disappoint them. Furthermore, going through the effort to write a review often stems from a place of appreciation for a drink they enjoyed. As a result, the chance of a **0/5** rating is much lower than that of a **5/5**, leading to a natural upward trend in average ratings over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis highlights a dual dynamic: while experienced reviewers bring stability and depth to ratings, the growing community of casual reviewers adds energy and enthusiasm, albeit with some inherent biases. Together, these groups paint a fuller picture of beer preferences, reflecting both expertise and the joy of discovery.\n"

    "### The Role of ABV in Beer Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to beer, alcohol by volume (ABV) plays a significant role in shaping preferences. Over the years, we've observed a fascinating trend: as time progresses, beer enthusiasts increasingly gravitate towards higher ABV beers. This shift is evident in the bubble plot below, where both an upward trajectory in ratings and a rightward movement in ABV demonstrate the growing popularity of stronger beers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ABV and Ratings Over Time](file-K833zMwK8UsGC4wDk9x5Bd)\n",
    "\n",
    "This trend aligns with the idea that higher ABV beers often pack a richer flavor and bolder profile, which resonate well with beer enthusiasts. While the preference for stronger beers has grown, it's also interesting to note how ABV has evolved globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Trends in ABV\n",
    "\n",
    "As we zoom out and look at the global picture, the map below illustrates the average ABV in beers across different countries over time. Lighter colors indicate higher ABVs, and as we move through the years, the world becomes progressively lighter, signaling a steady increase in ABV.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average ABV by Country Over Time](file-Y9D9GWb8TCD4aWjBN8fPBn)\n",
    "\n",
    "This upward trend suggests that breweries are responding to consumer demand for higher ABV beers, creating bolder brews that appeal to modern tastes. This increase also varies regionally, with certain countries exhibiting a stronger preference for high-ABV beers than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Styles of Beer: A World of Variety\n",
    "\n",
    "Beer styles are another key factor influencing preferences. The pie chart below showcases the distribution of different beer styles, revealing the diversity within the beer world. While India Pale Ales (IPAs) and Imperial Stouts lead the way, there’s a significant portion of the market dominated by other, less mainstream styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Distribution of Beer Styles](file-J7NUtrf4w7VpNCbbZ42WNp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beer styles also have regional preferences, as highlighted by the chord diagram below. This visualization captures the distinct clusters of beer styles preferred by different countries. For example, the United States leans heavily towards IPAs, while Belgium prefers its strong ales.\n",

    "### Tying It All Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection between ABV and style is clear: higher ABV beers, such as Imperial Stouts and Barleywines, have seen a rise in popularity, reflecting a global shift towards more robust brews. This trend is not only evident in the growing average ABV but also in the changing landscape of beer styles across the world.\n",
